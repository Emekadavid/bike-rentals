1. The categorical features are seasons, holiday, functioning_day and weekday, 
while the rest of the features are numerical. That's reasonable. 
3. Mutual information score suggests we remove the holiday feature from the dataset. 
This will be tested when creating the baseline model.  
4. Correlation coefficient scores suggests daysofyear, month and day might not 
have predictive importance with the target variable.
