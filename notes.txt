1. The categorical features are seasons, holiday, functioning_day and weekday, 
while the rest of the features are numerical. That's reasonable. 
2. The standard deviation of the target, rented_bike_count, is very high. 
This could indicate a skewed distribution. That is also noticeable for visibility 
and days of the year. This is not a problem for days of the year except for visibility.
